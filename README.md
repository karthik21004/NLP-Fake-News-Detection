Fake News Detection using NLP, SHAP, and Streamlit
This project is an end-to-end Fake News Detection system built using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
It uses a Machine Learning model to classify news articles as real or fake, provides explainable AI insights with SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), and offers a Streamlit web app for interactive use.

The aim is to combat misinformation by enabling quick, interpretable, and accurate detection of fake news.

Text Preprocessing: Lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization

Vectorization: TF-IDF or CountVectorizer for converting text into numerical features

Model Training: Logistic Regression / Random Forest / other ML models

Explainability: SHAP visualizations to interpret predictions

Interactive UI: Streamlit web app for real-time fake news detection

Dataset Handling: Automatically filters out large unnecessary files to meet GitHub's 50MB limit
